# Special_Wordle

In Wordle, you play with a 5x6 grid where you can type your guesses using an on-screen or physical keyboard. You'll get color-coded feedback for each letterâ€”green for correct, yellow for the right letter in the wrong spot, and gray for incorrect letters. The game only lets you submit valid 5-letter words, and if you guess wrong, you'll be notified.  

The twist is: after each game, you'll see your score and streak, and if you lose, you'll lose your streak, starting from 0 again. The more games you win, the more points you'll receive from each winning game. Oh, and you can track your highest score as you continue playing.

## Required Features

The following functionality is completed:
- [X] User sees a pre-rendered 5x5 grid where they can input their guesses with both their keyboard or by clicking the on-screen keyboard
- [X] User receives color-coded feedback indicating correct letters (green), incorrect letters (gray), and letters in the wrong position (yellow)
- [X] User can only submit valid 5-letter words and are notified when they've submitted an incorrect word
- [X] User sees a a win or loss message and learns of the correct word if they lose
- [X] User sees their total score and current streak as they can continue playing the game

## Notes

- I used two hardcoded text files for the words. The allowed.txt file denotes the allowed words a user can submit. For example, even if the word isn't the right word, it still is a proper submission/valid word if it is present in the allowed.txt file. The user will simply lose a guess for inputting the wrong word. The library.txt file is where we choose our words from.
- I used Local Storage to save the information such as highest score, current score, etc.
- For Next Steps, I can take care of this logic through a server. I can use an API to get my winning word. I can also check against the API to see if the word the user submitted is a valid word.
